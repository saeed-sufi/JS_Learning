* Nan is a "numeric value" that represents sth that is not a number!

* In js, variable type can be changed without any problem!

* Strings are immutable in js.

* `typeof` is an operator! just like `+` sign which is an operator.

* An array is a special type of object so we can look inside the array using a dot.

* In javascript almost everthing is an object even if it's not a real object, it is treated or interpreted as an object.

* An empty string of text will be evaluated as false.

* falsy values: false, 0, '', null, undefined, NaN, 0. Everything else is a truthy.

* Not(`!`) has a higher precedence that `&&` and `||`. `&&` has a higher precedence that `||`.

* In a switch structure when a case is evaluated to true, the next cases will not be evaluated! This is why we need to use `break` after each `case` is evaluated.
