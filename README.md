* Nan is a "numeric value" that represents sth that is not a number!

* In js, variable type can be changed without any problem!

* Strings are immutable in js.

* `typeof` is an operator! just like `+` sign which is an operator.

* An array is a special type of object so we can look inside the array using a dot.

* In javascript almost everthing is an object even if it's not a real object, it is treated or interpreted as an object.

* An empty string of text will be evaluated as false.

* falsy values: false, 0, '', null, undefined, NaN, 0. Everything else is a truthy.

* Not(`!`) has a higher precedence that `&&` and `||`. `&&` has a higher precedence that `||`.

* In a switch structure when a case is evaluated to true, the next cases will not be evaluated and they are executed subsequently! This is why we need to use `break` after each `case` is evaluated.

* A higher order function is a function that either: 1- accepts a function as an argument or 2- returns a function as a result.

* Javascript is special in the sense that functions are considered first class citizens or entities. So, we can pass them around as arguments, we can return them inside a function and we can even assign them to a variable. 

* The `Map` method is perfect when you want to create a new array that is based on another array.

* "Scope" is the biggest source of confusion regarding variables and "context" is the biggest source of confusion regarding objects.

* "Scope" is like a one way street. The traffic only flows in one direction. Code can reach outwards to access a variable but it cannot reach inwards.

* "let" uses a block scope whereas "var" uses a function scope.

* The `this` keyword points towards the object that is executing the current function.

* What `this` keyword points towards, changes depending on the "context".
